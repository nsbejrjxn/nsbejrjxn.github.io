	<h2>About Us</h2>

	<section>
	<h3>The Mission</h3>
	<p>To increase the number of culturally responsible Black engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally and positively impact the community.</p>

	<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
	<p>The National Society of Black Engineers <abbr title="National Society of Black Engineers">(NSBE)</abbr> was founded in 1975 at Purdue University by six students known as the Chicago Six. NSBE was created because there was a need to support blacks pursuing degrees in the field of engineering.  NSBE has grown to be the largest student run organization, with over 30,000 members.</p>

	<p>Just as there are NSBE collegiate and professional  members, NSBE Jr. is the formal membership category for NSBE's pre-college students in grades 6-12. Jackson, MS currently offers the  <strong><em>Summer Engineering Experience for Kids</em></strong>. This <strong>FREE</strong> three-week program is open to students who are current 3rd through 5th graders. The camp is very unique in Jackson because this is an all girls camp. With the success of this camp, we wanted to develop year long programming for students in the Jackson and surrounding area. In September 2014, Jackson State University NSBE Jr. Chapter was chartered.</p>

	<p>NSBE Jr. focuses on enhancing the education received by African-American and other minority pre-college students, as well as influencing these students to become tomorrow's corporate executives, entrepreneurs, and leaders.</p>

	<p>The goals of NSBE Jr. are to:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Help pre-college students develop a positive attitude towards academic excellence</li>
	<li>Encourage and support parental commitment to their children's education</li>
	<li>Stimulate enthusiasm about science, technology, engineering and mathematics among pre-college students</li>
	<li>Raise cultural awareness among African-American and other youth minorities</li>
	<li>Provide support to students throughout the college application process</li>
	<li>Increase college graduation rates of African-American students</li>
	<li>Prepare pre-college students to be positive, contributing future NSBE members</li>
	</ul>

	<p>NSBE is divided into six regions, in respect to the Chicago Six. The Jackson State University Jr. Chapter belongs to Region III. Region III is made up of the follwing.  Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, Florida, South America and the Caribbean. Below is the Region III motto:</p>
